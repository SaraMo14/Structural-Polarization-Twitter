## Domain
Structural polarization refers to the phenomenon where a network (such as a social or political network) becomes divided into distinct groups or “poles” based on certain opinions. 
In the context of the paper “Separating Polarization from Noise: Comparison and Normalization of Structural Polarization Measures” [1], structural polarization refers to the quantification of polarization within a network structure.

## Aims of the Research
 - Analyze structural polarization of datasets from Social Media
 - Compare the results of standard and normalized polarization measures
 - Study the correlation of the polarization measures under analysis
 - Propose one or more polarization scores

## Hypotheses to be Tested
- Randomized networks appear to be polarized even if they are randomly generated using the eight polarization measures from [1]
- The choice of the polarization scores has a lower impact than their normalization \cite{salloum2022separating}
- The process of normalizing polarization scores effectively reduces significant interference caused by the local properties of the network [1]

## Theoretical Framework
Network science, social network analysis, polarization measurement, community detection, and clustering.

## Methods
Generation of the randomized non-polarized networks; calculation of the following polarization scores: Random Walk Controversy (RWC), Adaptive Random Walk Controversy (ARWC), Betweenness Centrality Controversy (BCC), Boundary Polarization (BP), Dipole polarization (DP), E-I Index (EI), Adaptive E-I Index (AEI) and Modularity (Q) on polarized and non-polarized networks. Comparison between standard and normalized polarization metrics.
